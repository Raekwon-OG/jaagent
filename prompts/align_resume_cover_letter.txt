I'm applying for the job listed below.

Please help me with two things:

PART 1: Resume Optimization
Align my resume to this job while keeping everything honest and realistic.
Use keywords and phrasing that improve ATS compatibility.
Improve recruiter appeal by clearly showing how my experience fits.
Remove or reword points that are weak, redundant, or unrelated.
If adding any new bullet points, ensure they're realistic based on my background — even if slightly amplified, they should be things I could confidently pick up or already overlap with.
Update the professional summary to match the role but keep it grounded and credible.
Only edit the summary and experience sections.

PART 2: Cover Letter
Write a concise, professional, and natural-toned cover letter using a formal business letter format (include my address, company address, and date).
Keep the tone grounded and clear — avoid generic AI-style phrasing like "I am excited" or "passionate".
In the paragraph about the company, give a genuine, specific, and realistic reason for being interested in the role (e.g., what the company does, the scale of their work, the type of responsibilities, etc.).
Assume I'll be uploading this letter to an online application, but still keep it formal.
